# Mining Insights from Cancer-Related Discussions: A Text Analysis Approach

##
**Problem Statement**: To extract key insights from unstructured text data within cancer-related online forums and discussions.
**Goals**:
* To analyze the sentiment and emotional tone behind discussions.
* To identify prevalent topics and how they align with patient concerns.
* To observe trend shifts over time indicating changes in public awareness.
* To perform a comparative analysis across different cancer types.

## Tasks
**Sentiment Analysis**
To categorize the sentiment of discussions as positive, negative, or neutral by employing the TF-IDF vectorization method or BERT embeddings for text representation, and then using Support Vector Machines (SVM) or the BERT model for the classification task. 

**Topic Modeling**
We leverage SBERT for semantic embeddings and k-means for preliminary clustering. BerTopic then refines these topics, offering detailed insights.

**Trend Analysis**
* Trend analysis helps in understanding how the popularity of topics changes over time.
* Detect emerging discussions around new treatments or changes in community concerns.

**Comparative Analysis**
* To compare the volume and nature of discussions across different types of cancer.
* Quantitative analysis of topic occurrence and sentiment across cancer types.
* Insights to guide healthcare providers in resource allocation and support services.
