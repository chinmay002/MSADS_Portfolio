We conducted an analysis of the data, which involved various tasks such asdetermining the length of the longest token and character, identifying the data line containing this token, and calculating several metrics for each data item, including token
count, character length, unique tokens, and the number of special characters and digits present.
Based on our analysis, it has been observed that insincere questions have a greater count of tokens and character length compared to sincere questions. Furthermore,insincere questions also exhibit a higher number of unique tokens when compared to
sincere questions.
