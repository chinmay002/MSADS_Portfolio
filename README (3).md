# Coffee Sales Insights

## Introduction

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of coffee bean sales data using Microsoft Excel. The analysis encompassed data cleaning, transformation, and examination of sales records over the period from 2019 to 2022. The data was dissected from various perspectives, including the top 5 customers, countries, different roast types, package sizes, and loyalty card membership status.

## Data cleaning and Transformation

- Imported the raw data into Excel and check for missing values. I used the Filter function in Excel for the same.
- After data cleaning procedure, i decided how i want to make my dashboard and what all data would i need.
- I extracted data like coffee type, dates, country using XLOOKUP() command to make it clean and usable.
- Using IF() command, extracted the necessary data i wanted for visualization purpose.
- Using Pivot tables calculated Total sales overtime, top customers and countries.

## Visualization:

- With the help of pivot tables, created different charts which will be useful to create my final dashboard.
- Integrated timeline and slicers to make my charts dynamic for the imported data.
- Created my final dashboard using pivot charts, slicers and timeline and integrated them all together.
